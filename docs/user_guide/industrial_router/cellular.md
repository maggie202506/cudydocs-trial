- Network Type: The cellular technology standard in use (e.g., LTE, 5G).
- Upload/Download: Data transfer speeds for sending/receiving data.
- RSSI: Received Signal Strength Indicator, reflecting signal quality (closer to 0 is stronger).
- Public IP: The external IP address assigned by the carrier for internet communication.
- IP Address: The local/internal IP of the router within the cellular network.
- Connected Time: Duration since the router established the cellular connection.
- IMSI: International Mobile Subscriber Identity, unique subscriber identity stored in the SIM card.
- IMEI: International Mobile Equipment Identity, unique hardware identifier for the router.
- ICCID: Integrated Circuit Card Identifier, SIM card serial number.
- Mode: Current operational mode.
- MCC/MNC: Mobile Country Code and Mobile Network Code, identifying the carrier/country.
- Cell ID/PCID: Cell ID is Physical cell tower identifier, and PCID physical cell identity.
- Band/UL Bandwidth: Frequency band and uplink bandwidth for data transmission.
- DL Bandwidth: Downlink bandwidth allocated by the carrier for receiving data.
- RSRP: Reference Signal Received Power, Average power of LTE/5G reference signals.
- RSRQ: Reference Signal Received Quality, Signal quality ratio of RSRP to total interference/noise.
- SINR: Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio, Measures signal purity by comparing useful signal to interference/noise.
- CSQ: Command Signal Quality, Legacy metric for signal strength (0–31 scale), often used in 2G/3G.

- Current Traffic:Real-time data usage of the active cellular connection, to monitor immediate bandwidth consumption to detect anomalies.
- Monthly Traffic: Cumulative data usage within the current billing cycle, critical for cost control in metered plans.
- Total Traffic: Lifetime data transmitted/received since the router was deployed or reset. Long-term usage analysis for capacity planning and maintenance scheduling.

 
## Settings

On the **System Status >> Cellular >> Settings** or **General Settings >> Cellular** page，you can configure the following cellular features. 

### APN
<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Cudytech-pr/User-Guide/docs/images/industrial_router/general-settings-cellular-apn.webp" alt="" width="800px" style="border:  2px solid #eee;" />

1) Enable the APN feature. 
 
2) Enable the *Data Roaming* to allow your mobile device to connect to the internet or use cellular data when outside your carrier’s network coverage area, often involving additional charges.  
 
3) Select a *SIM Slot* (physical compartment) to insert your SIM card and enable network connectivity. *Auto* is recommended for automatic detection.

4) Select a *Network Mode* of the router's cellular network. *Auto* is recommended for automatic detection.

5) Select a means of *Network Search*. *Auto* is for automatic scanning and connection; or *Manual* requires a click on *Network Search* and selection of your SIM card carrier and network operator.

6) Select the *PDP* (Packet Data Protocol) *Type* that defines the protocol used for data transmission in mobile networks (e.g., IPv4 or IPv4/IPv6).  

7) Enable *Band Select* to allow manual selection of specific frequency bands for network connectivity, useful for optimizing signal strength or compatibility.  

8) Select a specific frequency range allocated for LTE (4G) networks which vary by region and carrier for *LTE Bands*.

9) Configure *APN Profile* to connect the router to the carrier’s data network, either selecting *Auto* or consulting your carrier for the APN parameters and manually enter it.

10) Click *Save & Apply* to save and activate the new settings or changes.  Displays the current state of cellular network connectivity, Connected or Disconnected.


### SMS

Click *Enable* and then *Save & Apply* to manage or monitor the router remotely by sending simple text commands or receiving automated alerts.


### Data Settings

1) Select SIM Slot 1 or 2 for your settings.

2) Enable *Monthly Data Statistics* to tracks total data usage within the current billing cycle.

3) Set a *Start Date* to reset date for monthly data calculation. Enter a positive integer value.

4) Check *Monthly Used* for the amount of data consumed in the current cycle. If necessary, enable *Correct* to manually adjust the inaccurate data usage records.

5) Enable *Data Limit* to set the maximum allowed data per month; triggers actions (e.g., shutdown) when exceeded.

6) Set *Monthly Allowance* to limit the monthly total data allocated for the billing cycle (e.g., 10GB).

7) Enable *SMS Alert for Usage* to get SMS notifications when data reaches predefined thresholds.

8) Set the percentage-based triggers (e.g., 80%, 90%) as *Usage Alert* to activate alerts before reaching the data limit.

9) Customize *Usage Alert Message* content, or keep the default warnings.

10) Enter the recipient *Phone Number* for receiving usage alerts.

11) Click *Save & Apply* to save and activate the new settings or changes.

### AT Command

AT Commands are standardized text-based instructions (e.g., AT+CSQ) used to configure, diagnose, and control cellular modules (4G/5G) in industrial routers, enabling APN setup, signal checks, and data management.

### Modem Reset
