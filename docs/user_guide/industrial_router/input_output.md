*About I/O*

- *Digital Input* (Associated Pin 1/6): Detects high-level signals (e.g., 24V) for equipment status monitoring (limit switches/sensors).
- *Isolated Input* (Associated Pin 2/7): Reads low-level signals (0V) with galvanic isolation (≥1500V) for safety interlock/emergency stops.
- *Analog Input* (Associated Pin 9): Supports 0-10V/4-20mA signals for precision measurement (temperature/pressure transmitters).
- *Isolated Output* (Associated Pin 3/4/8): Transistor outputs (On=0V, Off=high-Z) for driving relays/solenoids (≤0.5A load).
- *Relay* (Associated Pin 5/10): Electrically isolates control circuits from power circuits (e.g., 5V PLC → 240V motor). Select *Closed* (NO) when energized (current flows to load) or *Open* (NC) when de-energized (failsafe/default state).

!!! Note
    Use ferrite beads on analog wires to suppress EMI in noisy environments.

*About PWR*

- *Input* (Associated Pin 3): Receives external power to activate the device. 
    - High Level (Typ. 24V±10%): Normal power reception, device operational
    - Low Level (<1V): Power loss/undervoltage (check wiring/supply voltage)
    - Floating: Open circuit (verify terminal connection integrity)
- *Output* (Associated Pin 4): Supplies regulated power to connected peripherals.
    - On: Actively supplying power to peripherals (e.g., 24V/5V output enabled)
    - Off: Output disabled (manual shutdown or protection triggered)

## Input 
<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Cudytech-pr/User-Guide/docs/images/industrial_router/input.webp" alt="" width="800px" style="border:1px solid #eee; display:block; margin:0 auto;" />

Click *Add* to configure input rules to perform specified actions after the input meets the trigger conditions. 

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Cudytech-pr/User-Guide/docs/images/industrial_router/digital-input-1.webp" alt="" width="400px" style="border:1px solid #eee; display:block; margin:0 auto;" />

1. Click to Enable this entry of input rule.
2. Select an *Input Type* to define the signal category (e.g., digital/analog/pulse).
    - Digital Input(1): Standard binary input for detecting 24V signals.
    - Isolated Input(2,7): Galvanically separated input for safety-critical signal.
    - Digital Input(Power Socket 3): Power-monitoring input, detecting mains voltage presence via socket status.
    - Analog Input(6,9): Reads 0-10V/4-20mA signals for precision measurement.

3. Select a *Trigger* condition to activate the rule.
    - For Digital/Isolated Input, *Rising* triggers when signal transitions from low to high, ideal for power-on events; *Falling* triggers when signal transitions from high to low, used for emergency stop detection; *Both* responds to any voltage change, perfect for pulse counting or state monitoring.

    - For Analog Input, *Inside Range* triggers when the signal stays between Min/Max values; *Outside Range* triggers when the signal exceeds Min/Max thresholds.
        
4. Select *Analog Type* (for Analog Input) to match your sensor's output signal type. 
    - *Current (mA)* is used for 4-20mA/0-20mA industrial sensors (like pressure transmitters) as it’s resistant to signal degradation over long distances; 
    - *Voltage (V)* is used for 0-10V/±10V signals (like position sensors) with simpler wiring but shorter effective range due to voltage drop.
    - *Minimum (V) / Maximum (V)* (for Analog Input): Set voltage thresholds to define the valid range for voltage-based triggers.
    - *Minimum (mA) / Maximum (mA)* (for Analog Input): Configure current limits for current-loop device monitoring.

5. Select an *Action* to execute when the rule is triggered.
    - Activate Output: Triggers a designated output port. Then select a target *Output Type* and current input *State*, enter a *Revert* interval to determine auto-reset after trigger ends; enable or disable *Maintain* to decide lock state until manual reset.
    - Send SMS: Send alert messages via cellular module, which requires configured GSM/GPRS parameters. Edit the *SMS Text* as needed, add the *Phone number* to send your SMS.
    - SIM Switch: Automatically fails over to the selected backup SIM card when primary cellular signal is lost. Recommended to keep it *Auto*.
    - Turn on WiFi: Enables the router's WiFi for wireless client connections.
    - Turn off WiFi: Disables WiFi to conserve power or enhance security.
    - Reboot: Restart the system to apply configurations or recover from faults.

6. (Optional) Enter the *Execution Delay* time when will the action be executed after the rule being triggered.

Done! You have successfully configured an Input rule.

## Output

Click Add* to configure output scheduler to perform specified actions after the input meets the trigger conditions. 

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Cudytech-pr/User-Guide/docs/images/industrial_router/output-scheduler.webp" alt="" width="400px" style="border:1px solid #eee; display:block; margin:0 auto;" />

1. Click to *Enable* this entry of output scheduler.

2. Select an *Output Type* and *Change State to* to define the target output and state.
    - Isolated Output (3,4,8): Galvanically separated outputs for sensitive equipment, preventing ground loops in PLC/SCADA systems. Then select *Change State to* *High* for activating the optocoupler/solid-state relay to send the preset voltage to the connected device, or *Low* for cutting off output voltage to create an open circuit.
    - Relay (5,10): Electromechanical contacts for switching high-power loads. Then select *Change State to* *Closed* for physically connecting the relay’s internal contacts to allow current flow, or *Open* for breaking the contact to stop current flow.
    - Output (Power Socket 4): Direct mains power control for appliances, with built-in overload protection. Then select *Change State to* *High* for enabling mains power output, or *Low* for disconnecting mains power (safety cutoff).

3. Set *Start Time* for a-new-day shift start, and *Stop Time* for end-of-day shutdown. And specify *Repeat*weekdays for cyclical automation of the output schedule.
    - Weekdays (Mon-Fri): Ideal for factory equipment schedules (e.g., conveyor activation at 08:00-17:00).
    - Weekends (Sat-Sun): Used for non-routine operations (e.g., backup system tests).
    - 7-Day Cycle: For 24/7 critical systems (e.g., server room cooling).

Done! You have successfully configured an Output Scheduler.
