### Bridging
<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Cudytech-pr/User-Guide/docs/images/pon_router/image-39.webp" alt="" width=600px style="border: 1px solid #eee;" />

- Aging Time: The duration a bridge retains unused MAC address entries in its forwarding table before discarding them to free up resources. Default value is 300 seconds.

- 802.1d Spanning Tree: A legacy protocol (STP) that prevents network loops by dynamically disabling redundant paths in a bridged/switched network, ensuring a single active path.
For most networks—especially those with redundancy or unknown future changes—keeping STP enabled by default is the safer choice. Disable or replace it only after careful evaluation of risks and alternatives.

### Link Mode

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Cudytech-pr/User-Guide/docs/images/pon_router/image-41.webp" alt="" width=600px style="border: 1px solid #eee;" />

Set the Ethernet Link Speed/Duplex Mode to ensure stable and efficient communication by matching the data rate (e.g.,10/100/1000 Mbps) and transmission direction, both way simultaneously (Full Duplex) or alternately (Half Duplex), between connected devices. Proper settings prevent performance issues like packet loss or speed degradation caused by mismatched parameters. 

- Auto Mode: Automatically selects the highest compatible speed/duplex, reducing manual errors. It is recommended in most cases.

- 10M/100M/1000M Half/Full Mode:. In cases you have to manually set the Mode:

  - Always match settings on both ends (e.g., both 1000M Full Mode).

  - Avoid mismatches: Full Duplex on one end and Half Duplex on the other causes collisions
   
  - Verify with tools: 

    - Linux: `ethtool <interface>` 
    - Cisco: `show interfaces status`
    - Windows: `netsh interface show interface`, etc.

### RADVD

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Cudytech-pr/User-Guide/docs/images/pon_router/image-49.webp" alt="" width=600px style="border: 1px solid #eee;" />

RADVD (Router Advertisement Daemon) is an IPv6 service that broadcasts network prefixes and routing information to hosts, enabling SLAAC  (StateLess Address Auto-Configuration) without DHCPv6. It allows devices to automatically generate IPv6 addresses and discover default gateways via RA (Router Advertisement) messages.

- RADVD: Select *On* to configure *Prefix Mode* and *ULA*. Otherwise select *Off*.

- MaxRtrAdvInterval: Maximum time (in seconds) between Router Advertisement messages sent by the router (default:600s).

- MinRtrAdvInterval: Minimum time (in seconds) between Router Advertisement messages (default:0.33×MaxRtrAdvInterval).

- AdvManagedFlag: Select *On* to indicate DHCPv6 is required for IP addresses (not SLAAC), otherwise select *Off*.

- AdvOtherConfigFlag: Select *On* to tell devices to use DHCPv6 for DNS/other info (even if SLAAC is used for IPs), otherwise select *Off*.

- Prefix Mode: Select the Mode how network prefixes are advertised to devices.

① Auto(SLAAC): The router automatically advertises prefixes, allowing devices to generate their own IPv6 addresses (using Stateless Address Auto-configuration).For example, devices combine the prefix (2001:db8::/64) with their MAC to create a unique IP.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Cudytech-pr/User-Guide/docs/images/pon_router/image-99.webp" alt="" width=600px/>

- RDNSS Mode: Select *HGW Proxy* to manually configure DNS (e.g., custom servers like Cloudflare) and force devices to route DNS queries through the gateway; select *WAN Connection Mode* to automatically advertise the ISP's default DNS servers obtained from the WAN interface (e.g., via PPPoE/DHCPv6).

② Manual: Prefixes are statically configured and advertised without SLAAC. Address assignment relies on DHCPv6 or manual input. For example, in controlled environments where specific prefixes must be enforced.

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Cudytech-pr/User-Guide/docs/images/pon_router/image-97.webp" alt="" width=600px/>

  - Prefix: Enter the IPv6 network prefix.

  - Prefix Length: Set subnet size (e.g., /64 for a standard LAN).
  
  - AdvValidLifetime: Set the time (seconds) the prefix remains valid (e.g.,86400 = 1 day).
  
  - AdvPreferredLifetime: Set the time (seconds) for SLAAC address preference (e.g., 14400 = 4 hours).
  
  - RDNSS 1/2: Add recursive DNS servers (e.g., 2001:4860:4860::8888 for Google DNS).
  
- Enable ULA: Select *On* for private/internal networks (like IPv4's 192.168.0.0) or backup addressing; select *Off* if you only need global IPv6 (GUA) or avoid NAT-like complexities. 
  
- Apply Changes: Click to activate all the settings or changes.

- Outgoing Default Action: Select the default behavior for outgoing traffic. *Allow* for open environments where most traffic is trusted (e.g., home networks), while *Deny* for strict security to block all traffic unless explicitly permitted (e.g., corporate firewalls).

- Incoming Default Action: Select the default handling of incoming traffic. *Allow* for open networks where most incoming traffic is trusted (e.g., internal collaboration tools), while *Deny* for strict security to block all inbound traffic unless explicitly permitted (e.g., public-facing servers).

- Direction: Select the traffic flow for rule application. *Incoming* to control external-to-internal traffic (e.g., blocking attacks), while *Outgoing* to restrict internal-to-external flows (e.g., preventing data leaks).

- Protocol: Select a filter by transport layer protocol. *TCP* for reliable connection-based data (e.g., web browsing), *UDP* for low-latency non-connection traffic (e.g., video streaming), while *ICMPv6* for network diagnostics (e.g., ping, MTU discovery).

- Rule Action: Select Action to take if the rule matches (Permit or Block). *Allow* to explicitly permit matched traffic (e.g., whitelisting trusted services), while *Deny* to block specific threats or unwanted flows (e.g., blacklisting malicious IPs).

- Source IP Address: Enter a specific IPv6 address (e.g., 2001:db8::1) where the traffic to be filtered originates from.

- Source Prefix Length: Specifies the IPv6 subnet mask length (e.g., /64) for the source IPv6 address range, determining how broadly (e.g., entire network) or narrowly (e.g., single host) the rule applies.

- Destination IP Address: Enter a specific IPv6 address to send the target traffic to (e.g., ff02::1 for multicast).

- Destination Prefix Length: Defines the IPv6 subnet mask (e.g., /64) for the target network, controlling whether the rule applies to a single host (/128), a subnet, or broader ranges.

- Source Port: Enter the sender's port for the filtered traffic (e.g., 1024 for custom apps).

- Destination Port: Enter the receiver's port for the filtered traffic (e.g., 80 for HTTP).

- Apply Changes: Click to activate the change.

- Interface: Select the physical/virtual port for applying the rule. *WAN* for rules filtering external/internet-facing traffic (e.g., blocking inbound attacks), while *LAN* for internal network controls (e.g., restricting inter-VLAN access).

- Source IP Address: Set Source IP Address to specify the exact IPv6 host (2001:db8::1) or network range (2001:db8::/64) for traffic filtering, ensuring precise control over allowed/blocked sources.

- Source Prefix Length: Set Source Prefix Length to define the scope of source IPv6 addresses (e.g., /64 for a subnet, /128 for a single host), balancing specificity and flexibility in traffic filtering.

- Service: Defines rules to filter traffic for specific protocols (e.g., FTP, HTTP, ICMPv6) by matching ports (TCP/UDP) or ICMPv6 types (e.g., PING uses types 128/129).

  - Any: Select it only for broad rules (e.g., testing, default deny) but avoid it in strict security policies. It indicates a wildcard that matches all addresses (::/0) and ports (if unspecified).

  - FTP: File transfer protocol (TCP ports 20/21); select it for secure internal file transfers with authentication.

  - TFTP: Trivial FTP (UDP port 69); select it for simple, fast transfers in local networks (e.g., device configs).

  - HTTP: Web data protocol (TCP 80); select it for unencrypted web traffic (avoid on sensitive sites).

  - HTTPS: Secure HTTP (TCP 443); always prefer for encrypted web access (e.g., logins, payments).

  - PING: Network diagnostic tool (ICMPv6 types 128/129); select it to test connectivity, but block in strict ACLs for security.

- Add: Click to add the new entry into the *Current ACL Table*.
