# VPN

This is only available in *Main Router and AP Controller* mode.

VPN (Virtual Private Network) helps you access Internet resources remotely, securely, and privately through tunneling technology. When you access the Internet, VPN encrypts your personal information and hides your IP address from the public. For VPN users, it looks like the devices are directly connected. Cudy Router supports 6 types of VPN connections: PPTP, L2TP, OpenVPN, WireGuard, ZeroTier, IPSec (site-to-site). Please choose an appropriate VPN according to your needs and circumstances.

## IPSec (site-to-site) VPN
It is a secure tunneling protocol used to connect two different networks, typically a corporate network and a remote branch office network, over the Internet. It allows multiple users at the remote site to access resources on the main office network as if they were directly connected to it. Please follow the steps below to set up an IPSec (site-to-site) VPN connection.

**STEP 1. Get both Routers in the Headquarter and Branch Office ready.**

1. Make sure both Routers are connected to the Internet, but two network can not be in the same LAN segment. 
For example, if the headquarter is in the LAN segment 192.168.10.0/24, then the branches should be in a different LAN segment, say, 192.168.20.0/24.

2. Check and note down the WAN and LAN IP addresses of the Headquarter Router and Branch Office Router on their management Status page. WAN IP of the headquarters router is the remote gateway of the branch offices, and its LAN IP is the remote subnet of the branch offices; and vice versa.

**STEP 2: Configure the IPSec VPN on the Router in the Headquarter.**
<img src="../../../images/c200p/vpn-ipsec.png" alt="" width="800px" style="border: 1px solid #eee; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />

    - Policy Name: Name the policy as desired. 
    - Remote Gateway: Enter the WAN IP of the Router in branch office.
    - Local Subnet: Auto-filled the LAN segment of the local router.
    - Remote Subnet: Enter the LAN segment of the Router in branch office.
    - Preshared key: Set an encryption key as desired.
    - Dead Peer Detection: Enable to detect whether the peer end is alive or not.
    - Check Interval: Keep 30 seconds as default or change as needed.
    - DPD Timeout: Set when to perform PDP checking again. Keep 2 Minutes as default or change it as needed.
    - DPD Action: Decide what to do after DPD detection failure, Restart, Hold or Clear. It is recommended to keep Restart as default.

4. Click *Save & Apply*. 

**STEP 3: Configure the IPSec VPN on the Router in the Branch Office.**

1. Log into the Router B's management web page https://cudy.net (or 192.168.10.1). 

2. Go to *General Settings -> VPN*. Enable VPN, and select *IPSec (site-to-site)* as Protocol. 

3. Click *Add* to add IPSec Policies.
