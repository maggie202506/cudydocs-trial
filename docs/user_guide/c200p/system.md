# System
System is to manage the router’s systematic features. It includes System Time, Firmware, Backup/Restore, Administration, Admin Account, Language, Timed Reboot, Reboot, Reset, LED Control, and TR069 (not in Wireless Access Point mode).

## System Time
is the time displayed while the router is running. The system time you configure here will be used for other time-based functions like WiFi schedule, parental control, etc. 

**To configure the system time, please follow the steps below.**

1. Select your Timezone from the drop-down list.

2. Select a *Set Time* method: Get from Internet, Get from Managing Device, or Manual.
    - Get from the Internet: Router will synchronize the time with the Internet of the NTP server, for 	which you’ve entered its IP address or domain name.

    - Get from Managing Device: Router will synchronize the time with your device connected.

For more about firmware upgrading, please refer to [Advanced Settings-> Firmware](firmware.md)

<img src="../../../images/noteicon.png"> If you fail to update the firmware for the router, please contact our technical support [support@cudy.com](mailto:support@cudy.com).

## Backup/Restore
The settings are stored as a configuration file in the router. You can back up the configuration file in your computer for future use, or restore the router to a previous settings from the backup file when needed.

<img src="../../../images/ir04/backup.png" alt="" width="500px" style="border: 1px solid #eee;display:block; margin:0 auto;" />

- To back up the configuration file, just click **Generate backup** to download and save a copy of the current settings in your local computer in the form of *.bin* file.

- To restore the backup configuration file later on, click **Browser** to locate and upload the backup configuration file stored in your computer, and then click *Restore* to restore and reboot. It may take a few minutes. Please do not turn off or reset the router in this process.

<img src="../../../images/ir04/restore.png" alt="" width="500px" style="border: 1px solid #eee;display:block; margin:0 auto;" />

## Administration
allows you to access and manage the router from the local network devices via Local Management, and access and manage the router over the Internet via Remote Management.

<img src="../../../images/ir04/admin.png" alt="" width="500px" style="border: 1px solid #eee;display:block; margin:0 auto;" />

**Local Management**

- HTTPS Only: If enabled, you can access the router only via HTTPS, otherwise both HTTP and HTTPS are accessible.
- Local Managers: You can select *All Devices* to allow all LAN-connected devices to manage the router. If you want to specify certain devices to manage the router, please select *Specified Devices* and select or customize the device with its MAC address.

**Remote Management**

- Remote Management: If enabled, the remote devices on the Internet can access and manage the router. Otherwise, no remote devices on the Internet can do that.
- HTTPS port: Recommended to keep it as default settings.
- Remote Managers: You can select *All Devices* to allow all the remote devices on the Internet to manage the router. If you want to specify a certain device to manage the router, please select *Specified Devices* and enter the specific IP address in the *Only this IP address* field.

*Save & Apply* the above settings, and then the devices on the Internet can log in to **https://router’s WAN IP address:port number* to manage the router.

<img src="../../../images/noteicon.png"> You can find the WAN IP address of the router on *System Status -> WAN*. The router’s WAN IP is usually a dynamic IP. Please refer to *Advanced Settings -> Network -> DDNS* if you want to log into the router via a domain name.

## Admin Account
is to change your login password for the router’s web management page.

<img src="../../../images/ir04/admin-account.png" alt="" width="500px" style="border: 1px solid #eee;display:block; margin:0 auto;" />

1. Enter the old password.

2. Create a new password and Confirm it.

## Reboot 
Rebooting the router after working for a long periods of time can release some storage space in the RAM and improve system performance, making the operation of the router smoother. Rebooting does not affect any settings of the router.

<img src="../../../images/ir04/reboot.png" alt="" width="500px" style="border: 1px solid #eee;display:block; margin:0 auto;" />

Click *OK* to reboot the system immediately. Wait a few minutes for the system to reboot. 

<img src="../../../images/noteicon.png"> You may also reboot the router by turning off its power supply.

---
## Reset
will help you erase all the current settings and restore the router to its factory defaults. Alternatively, you may reset the router via the *RESET* button on the router panel, or on this web management page.

<img src="../../../images/ir04/reset.png" alt="" width="500px" style="border: 1px solid #eee;display:block; margin:0 auto;" />

Before clicking *OK* to reset it, please note down the SSID and password (or refer them to the product label) for later reconnection.

Wait a moment for it to reboot and reset. When completed, it will pop up the login page requiring you to create a password again. Create a new login password and reconfigure your router.

<img src="../../../images/noteicon.png"> 

1. During the rebooting process, do not turn off or reset the router. 
2. It's recommended to [back up](#backuprestore) the current configurations before resetting the router.

## TR069
TR-069, also known as CWMP (CPE WAN Management), allows Auto-Configuration Server (ACS) to perform auto-configuration, provision, connection, and diagnostics to this device. You may configure this function under your ISP’s instructions.

<img src="../../../images/ir04/tr069.png" alt="" width="500px" style="border: 1px solid #eee;display:block; margin:0 auto;" />
