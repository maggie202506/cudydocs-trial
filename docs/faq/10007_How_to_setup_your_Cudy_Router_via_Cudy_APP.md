**Preparations:**

- Unplug your modem and move the backup battery if it has one.
- Connect the router's WAN port to the powered-off modem via an Ethernet cable.
- Power on the modem, and then wait about 2 minutes for it to restart.
- Connect the power adapter to the router and wait the System LED turn to solid on (red or blue).
- Connect your phone to the router via Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
- Check the LEDs to confirm the hardware connections are correct.

!!! note
    Please make sure you can access internet when you connect the computer directly to the modem. This means that your broadband line is working normally. If you fail to access the internet, please contact your Internet Service Provider to solve the problem with the line first.

1. Check the default Wi-Fi SSID  (Cudy-XXXX and Cudy-XXXX-5G) and the Wi-Fi password on the label of the router. As shown below.

    There are 5 types of protocols, DHCP, PPPoE, Static(Fixed IP), L2TP, PPTP. You can change it according to the instructions of your ISP.

    - DHCP

        DHCP is the default and most simple protocol. It is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks for automatically assigning IP addresses and other communication parameters to devices connected to the network using a client–server architecture. There is no need to input any credentials and IP parameters.

    - PPPoE

        PPPoE is a protocol used by many Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Generally, your ISP will provide a modem and give you the username & password that you need when setting up the Internet connection.

        !!! note
            Please input the PPPoE username and password carefully. The router will not be able to connect to the internet if you input wrong username or password.

    - Static(Fixed IP)

        Static(Fixed IP) is required if your Internet Service Provider (ISP) has provided a fixed IP address for you or you want to configure the network information such as IP address, Gateway, Netmask, DNS manually.

    - L2TP and PPTP

        L2TP and PPTP are VPN protocols and can also be used for WAN connection. They are not a common protocol. You must input proper parameters to access the internet.

    - IPTV/VLAN

        Most broadband lines don't need to set this, then you can skip the IPTV/VLAN function. Tap "Next" after set the WAN parameters. But some ISPs use VLAN IDs to distinguish different services. If your broadband line needs to set the VLAN ID. You must enable the IPTV/VLAN function. As shown below.

        <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Cudytech-pr/User-Guide/docs/images/faq/10007/14_iptv_templates.webp" alt="iptv_templates" width="600px" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

        There are some default templates for the ISPs all over the world. You can choose the ISP name of your broadband line. If there is no template for your ISP or you want to customize the VLAN ID. You can set the mode to "Custom", then you can set it as your need.

        For example, if the VLAN 500 is used to transmit Internet services, VLAN 600 is used to transmit IPTV services. You can set it as the following.

        <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Cudytech-pr/User-Guide/docs/images/faq/10007/16_IPTV_VLAN_example.webp" alt="IPTV_VLAN_example" width="300px" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

        Set all the WAN connection parameters and tap "Next".


8. Set the Wireless parameters and tap "Next".

    You can set the 2.4G and 5GHz Wi-Fi name, Encryption and Wi-Fi password of your router. For "Encryption", we suggest WPA2-PSK/WPA3-SAE. But if there is some old device that only supports the old encryption protocol WPA-PSK. You can keep the Encryption to "WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK".

9. Check all the settings and tap "Apply". Click "Yes" to allow the router to restart. The settings are finished.

10. Then connect to the new Wi-Fi name you set before and login to the router again. Check the status of the router. The router will connect to the internet successfully.
